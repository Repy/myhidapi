# MyHIDAPI

* https://github.com/Repy/myhidapi

## DESCRIPTION:

This is a small wrapper around HIDAPI.  I couldn't get other HIDAPI wrappers to
work, so I wrote this one.  I'm using it to communicate with my keyboard, so
it really only supports enough of the HIDAPI to do that.

This gem is a fork from the original work by Aaron Patterson ([@tenderlove](https://github.com/tenderlove)).

* **Original Repository:** https://github.com/tenderlove/myhidapi

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Incomplete
* No tests
* Seems to work (for me)

## SYNOPSIS:

```ruby
 devices = MyHIDAPI.enumerate 0x0, 0x0
 dev = devices.find { |dev| dev.product_string == "ErgoDox EZ" }

 handle = dev.open

 while !handle
   p "retry"
   handle = dev.open
 end

 p handle

 buf = [0x0, 0x3, 35]
 loop do
   break if handle.write buf.pack('C*')
 end
 puts "done writing"

 buf = handle.read_timeout 1, 500
 p buf
 ```

## REQUIREMENTS:

This depends on libhidapi.

## INSTALL:

* Install hidapi.  On MacOS that is `brew install hidapi`
